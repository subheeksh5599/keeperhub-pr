/**
 * Static guard against docs-vs-code drift in the public API.
 *
 * For every (METHOD, /api/path) a page under docs/api/**.md advertises,
 * this script asserts that the corresponding Next.js App Router route file
 * (app/api/<segments>/route.ts) exists and exports a handler for that
 * method. Path parameters in docs (`{id}`) are mapped to the filesystem
 * convention (`[id]`).
 *
 * Three declaration formats are read, because pages use all three:
 *
 *   1. `http-fence`  - a fenced ```http block. The canonical form.
 *   2. `inline-code` - a `POST /api/keys` code span in prose or in a
 *                      markdown table cell. The method has to sit inside
 *                      the same span as the path, which is what keeps a
 *                      docs-site link like [User API](/api/user) - no
 *                      method, no span - from being read as a route.
 *   3. `code-sample` - a path literal passed as the first argument of a
 *                      recognised request call inside a ```ts / ```js
 *                      block: api("/api/user"), post("/api/keys", ...),
 *                      api(`/api/x/${id}/y`). The method comes from an
 *                      explicit `method: "POST"`, else from the helper
 *                      name, else GET. A call that is neither - new
 *                      URL("/api/x", base), console.log("/api/keys") - is
 *                      a string, not a declaration. A URL assembled from
 *                      variables (fetch(BASE + path)) is out of reach and
 *                      is deliberately not guessed at.
 *
 * Nothing inside an HTML comment is scanned, prose and fenced blocks
 * alike, and a line ending in `<!-- api-docs-ignore -->` is skipped in
 * all three formats, so a page can say that `POST /api/legacy/thing` was
 * removed without failing the build. In prose the marker renders as
 * nothing; inside a fence it renders as literal text, which is the price
 * of the fence being the natural place to write a removed endpoint.
 *
 * When the same endpoint is declared twice, the artifact records the
 * highest-priority format in the order above, so adding formats 2 and 3
 * never rewrites an entry an ```http fence already owns.
 *
 * Exits non-zero on any drift. Also emits specs/api-coverage.json so the
 * post-deploy live HEAD check (deploy-keeperhub.yaml) reads the same
 * source of truth without re-parsing markdown in YAML. Note that the
 * exit code is not the only signal: CI diffs the regenerated artifact
 * separately, so a clean exit with an uncommitted artifact still fails.
 *
 * Routes that exist in code but appear in no docs file are surfaced as
 * warnings, not failures - many internal/cron/og/auth routes are
 * intentionally undocumented.
