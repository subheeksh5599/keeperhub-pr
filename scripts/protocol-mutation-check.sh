# Mutation check for the Tier 0 protocol calldata tests.
#
# A coverage suite whose validity is never falsified can rot silently
# (seeded-but-never-runnable test data has shipped before). This script
# introduces a representative defect - renaming an ABI input in a
# protocol definition - and asserts the calldata tests go red, then
# restores the file. Run it after changing the Tier 0 harness; wire it
# into nightly CI alongside the full sweep.
#
# Requires a clean protocols/aave-v3.ts (the mutation target).
