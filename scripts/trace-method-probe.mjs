/**
 * trace-method-probe — regenerable trace-method availability probe
 *
 * The survey answering #2247 is #2273. This is the tool that keeps that table
 * checkable: re-run it and the numbers are re-derived from live endpoints
 * rather than trusted from a one-shot run.
 *
 * Why that matters concretely: trace size scales with a block's internal call
 * depth, not its transaction count, so two probes of the same chain and the
 * same tx count can differ several-fold. #2273 measured a 5-tx plasma-mainnet
 * block at 63 KiB / 101 KiB; this tool measured a different 5-tx block on the
 * same chain at 348 KB / 562 KB. Both are correct. A single block therefore
 * under-determines the cost envelope #2241 needs, and re-running is the cheap
 * way to bound it.
 *
 * Reports, per chain in `lib/rpc/rpc-config.ts`:
 *   1. which trace methods the endpoint actually answers
 *   2. response size (raw + gzipped) for one block's traces
 *   3. fetch and parse time
 *
 * Three design rules, because the survey is only worth what it can be trusted on:
 *
 *   REGENERABLE — the chain list is parsed out of `rpc-config.ts` at run time,
 *   never hand-typed. The config drifts (it gained plasma/0g/robinhood since
 *   #2239 was written); a hand-copied table would silently go stale.
 *
 *   HONEST — we record the exact error body and classify from it. "method not
 *   found", a 401 tier gate and a timeout are three different findings and the
 *   distinction is most of the value here. Nothing is inferred from a docs page.
 *
 *   POLITE — these are free third-party endpoints. Strictly sequential, one
 *   delay between every request, tiny sample. We are surveying capability, not
 *   load-testing someone's public infrastructure.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs                        # all chains, live-fetch the config
 *   node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs --only 1,8453          # just these chain ids
 *   node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs --mainnets             # skip testnets
 *   node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs --config ./rpc.ts      # use a local rpc-config.ts
 *   node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs --dry-run              # resolve targets, make no requests
 *   node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs --out ./results        # output directory (default ./out)
 *
 * Writes results.json (full raw record) and report.md (the table).
 * No dependencies. Node 20+.
