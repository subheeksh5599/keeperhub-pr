/**
 * QA for the pure functions in trace-method-probe.mjs.
 *
 * classify() is the piece the whole survey rests on: if it mislabels a tier
 * gate as "not supported", #2241 gets scoped against a wrong answer. Live
 * probing only exercises whatever the network happened to return today, so the
 * refusal shapes are pinned here instead.
 *
 * HOW THIS RUNS: `pnpm test:trace-probe`, or `node --test` directly. It is
 * deliberately outside vitest — `vitest.config.mts` matches only `.ts`/`.tsx`,
 * and this file tests a dependency-free `.mjs` research script that is not part
 * of the application build. The package script exists so the cases are executed
 * rather than being assertions someone has to remember to run.
