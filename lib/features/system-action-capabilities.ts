// Egress classification for built-in / system actions.
//
// System actions are not plugins, so they carry no `egress` field. This map is
// their source of truth. It is typed `Record<SystemActionType, EgressTier>`,
// and the executor's SYSTEM_ACTIONS dispatch table is `satisfies
// Record<SystemActionType, StepImporter>` - both keyed off the shared
// SYSTEM_ACTION_TYPES union - so a new system action is a compile error until it
// is both dispatched and classified here.
//
// Light imports only (a type and a const) - safe for client, server, edge, and
// the validator; does not pull in the executor.
