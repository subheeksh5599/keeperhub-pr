/**
 * Build a fully qualified function key to disambiguate overloaded ABI functions.
 * Returns "deposit(uint256,address)" when the ABI has multiple `deposit` overloads,
 * or the plain function name when unambiguous.
 *
 * Tuple parameters are expanded into their canonical component types, so an
 * overload taking a struct becomes "swap((address,uint256))" -- the spelling
 * `ethers` accepts. Building it from the raw ABI types instead yields the
 * literal "tuple", which neither encodes nor distinguishes two overloads that
 * differ only inside the struct.
 *
 * Overloads are counted by the resolved entry's own name rather than by
 * `functionName`, because callers pass whatever key was stored -- which is
 * already a qualified signature for anything configured through the function
 * selector. Counting by that string matches no ABI entry, and the key would be
 * handed back unchanged.
