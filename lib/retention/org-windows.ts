 * enterprise) and is advertised in the upsell modal, but until this job it had
 * no server-side reader at all.
 *
 * Resolution mirrors the entitlement path exactly: the plan alone decides, not
 * the subscription status, so a `trialing` or `past_due` Pro org keeps the Pro
 * window (see getOrgPlan / checkFeatureAccess in lib/billing/plans-server.ts).
 * A per-org `plan_overrides.logRetentionDays` wins, which is how a custom
 * contract gets a window the public plans do not offer.
 *
 * Two clamps keep a bad value from deleting live data: the configured floor
 * raises any window below it, and an org with no subscription row falls back to
 * the configured default rather than to zero. On prod that fallback covers most
 * organizations - 975 of 1409 have no subscription row - and it matches
 * getOrgPlan, which also reads a missing row as the free plan.
