/**
 * The single source of truth for "is this workflow live enough to run". A
 * workflow is executable only when it is enabled, not soft-deleted, not
 * deactivated, and its owning organization is not deactivated. All five
 * execution entry points (scheduler select, executor dispatch, HTTP execute,
 * webhook, agent-call lookup) must gate on this so they cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Ownership lives on the ORGANIZATION, not the creating user: `workflows.userId`
 * is createdBy (audit only) and is never an execution-authority signal. Owner
 * deactivation is handled at the org level - deactivating an org owner cascades
 * to `organization.deactivated_at` (when no active owner remains), which this
 * predicate honors.
 *
 * Two shapes are exported because the entry points come in two flavours:
 * - SELECT sites compose `workflowExecutableConditions()` into their WHERE.
 * - fetch-then-gate sites call `getWorkflowExecutability()` on a loaded row.
 * Both encode the same columns, in one file, so they stay in lockstep.
 *
 * This module must stay free of `@/lib/db` and `server-only` imports: the
 * standalone executor imports it via a relative path and `getWorkflowExecutability`
 * may reach client bundles. Org deactivation is loaded by each call site with
 * its own db handle, never here.

/**
 * Drizzle WHERE fragment for "exists and is not gone": not soft-deleted, not
 * deactivated, and owned by an active org, but WITHOUT the `enabled` clause.
 * Used by the agent-call lookup, which surfaces a listed-but-disabled workflow
 * as "temporarily unavailable" rather than 404, so it gates `enabled` in-memory
 * after the row loads.
 *
 * REQUIRED: the caller's query MUST join `organization` on
 * `workflows.organizationId` before composing this fragment. An inner join is
 * safe because `workflows.organizationId` is NOT NULL. Omitting the join
 * produces a runtime SQL error ("missing FROM-clause entry for table
 * 'organization'"). If you cannot add the join, use `getWorkflowExecutability()`
 * on the loaded row instead.

 * the deactivation states because those are permanent ops off-states while an

 * soft-deleted workflow can still be enabled (`softDeleteValues()` clears
 * `isListed` but not `enabled`) and "gone" is the most accurate signal.
