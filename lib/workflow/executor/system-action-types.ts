// Single source of truth for the built-in (non-plugin) action types the

// map (lib/features/system-action-capabilities.ts) are keyed off this union via
// `satisfies` / `Record<SystemActionType, ...>`, so adding a system action is a
// compile error until it is BOTH dispatched and classified. No imports - safe to
// load anywhere (client, server, edge, tests).
