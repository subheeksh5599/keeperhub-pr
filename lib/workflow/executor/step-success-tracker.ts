/**
 * KEEP-1541: In-memory tracker for step successes within a workflow execution.
 *
 * Both withStepLogging (step-handler.ts) and the workflow executor run in the
 * same Node.js process, so a module-level Map is sufficient. This replaces the
 * HTTP loopback approach that failed silently in production.
 *
 * Only successes are tracked. The reconciler treats a tracked success as proof
 * that the step completed, regardless of subsequent SDK retry errors. This is
 * safe because withStepLogging records success only after the step function
 * returns without error -- the "max retries exceeded" error originates from
 * the SDK's durability layer, not from the step itself.
 *
 * KEEP-543: tracker is now iteration-aware. Body nodes inside a parallel For
 * Each loop execute once per iteration with the same nodeId; the iteration
 * key (forEachNodeId + iterationIndex) disambiguates them so spurious-recovery
 * inside the body runner returns the correct iteration's output instead of
 * whichever iteration was last to record.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. withStepLogging calls recordStepSuccess() after each successful step
 *      (with iterationKey when the step ran inside a For Each iteration)
 *   2. The executor / body runner calls getStepSuccess() during max-retries
 *      reconciliation, threading the iteration key when applicable
 *   3. The executor calls clearExecution() in a finally block to free memory

/**
 * Whether a step's self-reported hash is one this execution can record and
 * later re-verify against the chain.
 *
 * Solana signatures are base58, not 0x-hex, so a bare 0x prefix test drops
 * every one of them and the finalize gate never sees a Solana write at all.
 * When the step reported which chain it was on, the hash is instead checked
 * against the shape that chain actually uses (validateChainTxHash), which
 * still rejects junk.
 *
 * A hash with no chainId keeps the 0x test on purpose. reconcileTransactionHashes
 * fails the whole batch conclusively for a hash it cannot attribute to a chain,
 * so admitting a base58 hash from a step that reports no chainId
 * (transfer-spl-token-core, call-solana-program-core,
 * send-raw-solana-instruction-core) would settle runs that actually succeeded
 * as failed. Those steps not reporting chainId is a separate defect; dropping
 * their hash is what happens today and is the lesser of the two errors until
 * it is fixed.
 *
 * Both helpers are imported from leaf modules rather than provider-factory /
 * validate-chain-address: this file is reachable from executor.workflow.ts,
 * so whatever it imports is compiled into the workflow-function bundle, where
 * @solana/web3.js, ethers, safeFetch and the db client are all rejected.
