/**
 * Wrapper around Turnkey's Gas Station / Transaction Management API.
 *
 * Turnkey's native sponsorship is NOT an ERC-4337 paymaster. It is a single
 * activity (`ethSendTransaction` with `sponsor: true`) that signs the
 * transaction with the sub-org's wallet, fills gas from Turnkey's Gas
 * Station, and broadcasts. The activity returns a `sendTransactionStatusId`
 * which we poll until the transaction is broadcast and a hash is available.
 *
 * Return contract:
 *   - `null` only for failures that are certain to have happened BEFORE
 *     anything was broadcast: an unsupported chain, an `ethSendTransaction`
 *     rejection that Turnkey returned without accepting the activity, or a
 *     terminal-failure status with no tx hash. Callers may safely fall back to
 *     direct signing.
 *   - A transport failure or timeout on the send request is NOT one of those,
 *     because it cannot distinguish "not received" from "received and
 *     executing". It is reported as a pending error so the caller never
 *     re-sends.
 *   - `SponsoredTxRevertError` when the tx broadcast and reverted on-chain.
 *   - `SponsoredTxPendingError` when the send was accepted but we could not
 *     confirm its outcome within the wait window (Turnkey slow to broadcast,
 *     or its status API kept erroring). The tx may still land, so callers MUST
 *     NOT fall back -- doing so double-sends from the same wallet.
