/**
 * Canonicalise a declared ABI type so an alias cannot slip past the shape
 * comparison above.
 *
 * `inputTypes` reaches this module as the RAW strings from the caller-supplied
 * ABI, while the selector is computed from the canonical form. Solidity treats
 * `uint` as an alias of `uint256`, so an ABI declaring
 * `transfer(address,uint)` encodes selector 0xa9059cbb -- byte-identical to a
 * real ERC-20 transfer -- yet a literal string comparison against "uint256"
 * fails, matchOutflowFunction returns null, and the caller short-circuits to
 * ALLOWED without ever loading the token or comparing an amount. That is a
 * complete bypass of this ceiling via a one-word change to an
 * attacker-supplied ABI.
 *
 * ParamType.from applies the same normalisation ethers uses when building the
 * selector, so the two agree. A type ethers cannot parse is passed through
 * unchanged: it will not match a shape, but it also cannot be encoded into a
 * transaction, so there is nothing to bypass.
