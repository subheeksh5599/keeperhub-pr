/**
 * Sum of gas paid by KeeperHub sponsorship over the window (in wei), read from
 * the gas_credit_usage ledger but scoped to the same runs `getWorkflowGasTotal`
 * counts: joined through the execution, windowed on `started_at`, and limited
 * to runs that have already written their `gas_used_wei` rollup.
 *
 * The scoping is what lets the KPI derive the wallet share by subtraction. The
 * ledger inserts per confirmed transaction while the rollup is only written at
 * finalize, so summing the ledger on its own axis would subtract gas from runs
 * that have not landed in the total yet - on a 1h range that is the normal
 * case, not an edge, and it would drive the wallet figure to zero. The join
 * also makes the figure project-attributable, where the raw ledger is not.
 *
 * Caveat: this sums native gas across chains and the Gas Spent KPI renders it
 * as ETH, so a non-ETH chain's gas (e.g. Polygon's POL) is counted as ETH. It
 * is a deliberate single-figure approximation that mirrors the existing
 * cross-chain Gas Spent headline; the accurate per-network breakdown lives on
 * the Billing gas-sponsorship panel and the runs table.
