/**
 * Canonical hosted Blockscout instance per chain ID.
 *
 * Single source of truth shared by the plugin definition (the Chain selector's
 * allowed chains) and the step runtime (instance resolution). Adding a chain
 * here makes it available everywhere -- no other edits needed.
 *
 * Chains not listed here require a Blockscout connection with an explicit
 * instance URL (BLOCKSCOUT_API_URL).
 *
 * Kept free of "server-only" so the client-loaded plugin definition can import
 * it (the step runtime is server-only and imports it via blockscout-core).
