/**
 * Atomically check the daily value cap and create the execution record.
 *
 * The cap bounds the native notional VALUE moved per org per day, not gas.
 * `params.reserved` (known at request time) is charged against the cap for its
 * chain family inside a transaction holding the org's cap row (see
 * lockOrgSpendCapRow, which creates the row when the org has none so that the
 * lock exists), which serializes concurrent requests for the same organization
 * whether or not it ever configured a cap. The execution record is
 * inserted in the same transaction carrying its value, so the reservation is
 * immediately visible to subsequent callers -- closing the TOCTOU that the old
 * gas-based cap had (pending/running rows had null gasUsedWei and contributed 0
 * to the SUM).
 *
 * There are two independent caps, both set by org admins/owners:
 *   EVM    -> dailyValueCapWei             charged in wei      (18 decimals)
 *   Solana -> dailySolanaValueCapLamports  charged in lamports (9 decimals)
 *
 * They are deliberately not one number. An admin sets the wei cap thinking in
 * ETH; folding SOL into it would compare non-commensurable assets against a
 * single figure, and scaling SOL to 18 decimals to fit was only ever a
 * workaround for the missing second cap. Each cap sums only its own ledger
 * column, so neither chain family's activity consumes the other's budget.
 *
 * When no cap row exists, or the column for that family is null, the platform
 * default for that family applies (see lib/execute/spend-cap-defaults.ts).
 * Unconfigured no longer means unlimited: an organization raises its ceiling by
 * setting one, not by never having set one. An unset Solana cap still does NOT
 * fall back to the wei cap; it falls back to the Solana default.
