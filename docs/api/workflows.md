# Workflows API

Manage workflows programmatically.

## List Workflows

```http
GET /api/workflows
```

Returns workflows for the authenticated user (session) or organization (API key).
Returns every workflow unless `limit` is supplied.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `projectId` | string | Optional. Filter workflows by project ID |
| `tagId` | string | Optional. Filter workflows by tag ID |
| `limit` | number | Optional. Page size, 1 to 200. Omit for the complete list |
| `offset` | number | Optional. Rows to skip, from 0. Requires `limit` |

`limit` must be a whole number from 1 to 200. `offset` must be a whole number of
0 or more, because offset 0 is the first page. Values outside those ranges,
values that are not plain decimal integers (`0x1f4`, `1e2`, `%205`), and `offset`
supplied without `limit` are each rejected with `400 invalid_input`.

A page is never silently shortened. Asking for more than the maximum page size
is rejected rather than trimmed, so a response holding fewer rows than `limit`
always means the end of the list. Page by requesting successive offsets until
that happens.

The body is a bare JSON array whether or not `limit` is supplied.

### Example

```http
GET /api/workflows?projectId=proj_123&tagId=tag_456
```

### Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": "wm3k8nq7xcz2jv4hpbtd5",
    "name": "My Workflow",
    "description": "Monitors ETH balance",
    "visibility": "private",
    "nodes": [],
    "edges": [],
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Get Workflow

```http
GET /api/workflows/{workflowId}
```

Returns a single workflow by ID.

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "wm3k8nq7xcz2jv4hpbtd5",
  "name": "My Workflow",
  "description": "Monitors ETH balance",
  "visibility": "private",
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...],
  "publicTags": [
    {
      "id": "tag_1",
      "name": "DeFi",
      "slug": "defi"
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "isOwner": true
}
```

Public workflows include a `publicTags` array showing all assigned tags.

## Create Workflow

```http
POST /api/workflows/create
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "New Workflow",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "projectId": "proj_123",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "trigger",
      "type": "trigger",
      "data": {
        "label": "Schedule Trigger",
        "config": { "triggerType": "Schedule", "scheduleCron": "*/30 * * * *" }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "supply-aave",
      "type": "action",
      "data": {
        "label": "Supply USDC to Aave",
        "config": {
          "actionType": "aave-v3/supply",
          "network": "8453",
          "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
          "amount": "100000000",
          "onBehalfOf": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "trigger->supply-aave",
      "source": "trigger",
      "target": "supply-aave"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note on Node Format:** For action nodes, set the outer `type` to `"action"` and place the plugin slug in `config.actionType`. The `data` object contains `label` and `config`; `status` and `position` are optional and auto-assigned by the API if omitted. Trigger nodes use outer `type: "trigger"` with `config.triggerType` set to the Pascal-case trigger name.
>
> The server normalizes the request before persisting it, so the saved node will also include an inner `data.type` field set to the kind discriminator (`"trigger"` or `"action"`). You do not need to send `data.type` yourself; if you do, it must match the outer `type`. As a convenience, sending the plugin slug at the outer `type` (for example `"type": "aave-v3/supply"`) is also accepted, and the server rewrites it into `config.actionType` during normalization.

`name`, `nodes`, and `edges` are required. `description`, `projectId`, `tagId`, and `enabled` are optional. `projectId` assigns the workflow to a [project](/api/projects); `tagId` assigns it to an organization tag for categorization; `enabled` (boolean) controls whether the workflow is active on creation.

### Generic web3 write-contract example (Manual trigger)

Named-protocol actions (`aave-v3/supply`, etc.) hide most of the plumbing behind protocol-aware config keys. When you want to call an arbitrary contract that isn't in the [plugin catalog](/plugins/web3), use the generic `web3/write-contract` action. The trap is that the UI labels ("Function", "Function Arguments") don't line up 1:1 with the API field names, and `functionArgs` is a **JSON-encoded array string**, not a raw array. The full config shape:

```json
{
  "name": "Release escrow on Sepolia",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "trigger-1",
      "type": "trigger",
      "data": {
        "label": "Manual",
        "config": { "triggerType": "Manual" }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "step-1",
      "type": "action",
      "data": {
        "label": "Release Escrow",
        "config": {
          "actionType": "web3/write-contract",
          "network": "11155111",
          "web3Connection": "default",
          "contractAddress": "0x599869cef2e4c52e2c9074caaf8f9fb0cb191776",
          "abi": "[{\"type\":\"function\",\"name\":\"release\",\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"depositId\",\"type\":\"bytes32\"}],\"outputs\":[]}]",
          "abiFunction": "release",
          "functionArgs": "[\"{{@trigger-1:Manual.depositId}}\"]"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "id": "e", "source": "trigger-1", "target": "step-1" }
  ]
}
```

Field-name gotchas the strict validator will reject:

| UI label | API field name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Function | `abiFunction` | Not `function`, `method`, or `functionName`. See the note below on `functionName`. |
| Function Arguments | `functionArgs` | A JSON-encoded array **string** (`"[\"0x…\"]"`), not a raw array. Templates inside the string are resolved before `JSON.parse`. |
| Web3 Connection | `web3Connection` | Sender routing: `"default"` (org policy), `"eoa"` (force the Turnkey EOA), or `"safe:<safeWalletId>"`. The signing wallet is your org's Turnkey wallet, resolved automatically. |
| Contract ABI | `abi` | JSON-encoded string, not a raw array — same shape convention as `functionArgs`. |

A warning on `functionName` and `args`: the save-time validator accepts them, because workflows persisted before a field rename still carry that shape and have to stay re-savable. The runtime does not translate them. A workflow that uses `functionName` will therefore save without complaint and then fail at execution with ``Missing `abiFunction` in the step config``. Always send `abiFunction` and `functionArgs`.

Trigger data reference from a downstream action uses the [stored templating format](/workflows/templating): `{{@<nodeId>:<Label>.<field>}}`. Fields on the `input` object are spread into the trigger's output, so `{"input": {"depositId": "0x…"}}` sent to [`POST /api/workflows/{id}/execute`](#execute-workflow) is reachable at `{{@trigger-1:Manual.depositId}}`. Valid `triggerType` values are `Manual`, `Schedule`, `Webhook`, `Event`, `Block`, and `Transfer`; a `Webhook` trigger receives the same treatment on its own `POST /api/workflows/{id}/webhook` URL.

### Response

Returns the created workflow with a default trigger node and an empty action node connected to it.

## Update Workflow

```http
PATCH /api/workflows/{workflowId}
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "description": "Updated description",
  "projectId": "proj_123",
  "tagId": "tag_456",
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...],
  "visibility": "private"
}
```

The `tagId` field assigns the workflow to an organization tag for categorization.

## Delete Workflow

```http
DELETE /api/workflows/{workflowId}
```

Returns `409 Conflict` if the workflow has execution history. Use the `force` query parameter to cascade delete all runs and logs:

```http
DELETE /api/workflows/{workflowId}?force=true
```

## Execute Workflow

```http
POST /api/workflows/{workflowId}/execute
```

Manually trigger a workflow execution. The singular form `POST /api/workflow/{workflowId}/execute` is also accepted for backward compatibility.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "input": { "key": "value" }
}
```

The `input` field is optional. It maps to the workflow's trigger input and is passed to the first node of the run. Input fields should be nested under `input`; a body with fields at the top level instead (e.g. `{"amount": "1"}` rather than `{"input": {"amount": "1"}}`) is still accepted and now binds correctly, but the response carries the standard `Deprecation`, `Sunset`, and `Link` headers -- support for the unnested shape will be removed no earlier than the `Sunset` date. Every response decided once the body has been read carries them, idempotent replays included. Responses decided before that point do not, because the shape of the body has not been looked at yet: a 404, an authentication or permission failure, a plan or quota block, the concurrency `429`, and an unexpected `500` all answer without the headers. In the unnested shape every top-level field binds as input, `executionId` included; it is only read as an envelope field alongside a nested `input` -- with one exception. A flat body whose *only* key is `executionId` is indistinguishable from the envelope shape, so it is read as an envelope field and rejected (see [`executionId` is not yours to set](#executionid-is-not-yours-to-set)). Send at least one other field, or nest your data under `input`. A body mixing both shapes, or with `input` set to something other than an object, returns a 400. In either shape a top-level input field named `__proto__` is dropped before the run starts, with no error; fields nested deeper inside your values are left alone. One consequence worth knowing if you send the unnested shape: a flat body cannot carry a field of its own named `input`, because there is no way to tell it from the envelope. If your input data has a field by that name, wrap the whole object -- `{"input": <your object>}`. This differs deliberately from the [webhook trigger](#webhook-trigger) route, which takes the entire request body as the input: a webhook carries an external caller's payload that can't be asked to nest itself under `input`, whereas the execute route uses KeeperHub's own envelope and so can require the nested shape.

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.keeperhub.com/api/workflows/wm3k8nq7xcz2jv4hpbtd5/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEEPERHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {}}'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "executionId": "k6r4t9yqmn2xwv8jsz0a3",
  "status": "running"
}
```

### `executionId` is not yours to set

The run's id is assigned by KeeperHub and returned to you as `executionId`.
Sending one is reserved for internal dispatch -- the scheduler and the queue
executor, which pre-create the row before routing back through this endpoint.
A request authenticated with an API key or a session is never internal, so a
body carrying the field is refused:

| Status | `code` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `execution_id_not_allowed` | The body carried an `executionId`. Omit it and read the id from the response. |

This applies to the nested shape, where `executionId` sits alongside `input`
and is read as an envelope field. In the unnested shape it is ordinary input
data and binds like any other key -- except in the one case noted above, where
it is the body's only key and the two shapes cannot be told apart.

## Webhook Trigger

```http
POST /api/workflows/{workflowId}/webhook
```

Trigger a workflow via webhook. Requires API key authentication.

## Duplicate Workflow

```http
POST /api/workflows/{workflowId}/duplicate
```

Creates a copy of an existing workflow.

## Download Workflow

```http
GET /api/workflows/{workflowId}/download
```

Download workflow definition as JSON.

## Generate Code

```http
GET /api/workflows/{workflowId}/code
```

Generate SDK code for the workflow.

## Claim Workflow

```http
POST /api/workflows/{workflowId}/claim
```

Claim an anonymous workflow into the authenticated user's organization. Only the original creator of the anonymous workflow can claim it.

## Publish Workflow (Go Live)

```http
PUT /api/workflows/{workflowId}/go-live
```

Publish a workflow to make it publicly visible with metadata and tags.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "Public Workflow Name",
  "publicTagIds": ["tag_1", "tag_2"]
}
```

The `name` is required. `publicTagIds` is an array of public tag IDs to associate with the workflow (maximum 5 tags).

## List Public Workflows

```http
GET /api/workflows/public
```

Returns all public workflows with optional filtering.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `featured` | boolean | Optional. Filter for featured workflows (`?featured=true`) |
| `featuredProtocol` | string | Optional. Filter for protocol-featured workflows (e.g., `?featuredProtocol=sky`) |
| `tag` | string | Optional. Filter by public tag slug (e.g., "defi", "nft") |

### Response

```json

GET /api/mcp/schemas
```

Returns the complete registry of available workflow actions, triggers, and templates. Essential for programmatic workflow generation to discover valid action configurations.

### Response Structure

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "actions": {
    "web3/check-balance": {
      "actionType": "web3/check-balance",
      "label": "Check Balance",
      "category": "web3",
      "integration": "web3",
      "requiredFields": { "network": "string (chain ID)", "address": "string" },
      "optionalFields": {},
      "outputFields": { "balance": "..." },

      "featureEnabled": true
    }
  },
  "triggers": {
    "Schedule": {
      "triggerType": "Schedule",
      "label": "Schedule",
      "requiredFields": { "scheduleCron": "string" },
      "optionalFields": { "scheduleTimezone": "string" }

  "builtinVariables": {
    "nodeId": "__system",
    "nodeLabel": "System",
    "variables": { "unixTimestamp": {...}, "unixTimestampMs": {...}, "isoTimestamp": {...} }
  },
  "workflowStructure": { "nodeStructure": {...}, "edgeStructure": {...} },
  "tips": ["actionType must match exactly", "..."]
}
```

> **Note on Action Types:** The keys in the `actions` object are the values to use in `config.actionType` when creating workflow nodes.
> - **Plugin actions** use a `{pluginType}/{slug}` format (e.g., `"web3/check-balance"`, `"aave-v3/supply"`).
> - **System actions** use Pascal-case with spaces between words (e.g., `"Condition"`, `"For Each"`, `"HTTP Request"`). System actions do not have a `requiresCredentials` field.
> - **Triggers** are listed under the `triggers` key (not `actions`) and their values map to `config.triggerType` on trigger nodes.
> - The endpoint self-documents the correct node and edge shapes under the `workflowStructure` and `edgeStructure` keys — use these as the source of truth for programmatic workflow generation.

Every action carries a `requiredPlan` field (the plan an organization must be on to run the
action, or `null` when it is not plan-gated) and a `featureEnabled` field (false only when the
gating feature has been rolled back for every plan). Both are the static requirement, never
your organization's plan, so this endpoint stays anonymous and publicly cacheable. Check them
before building a workflow so a `POST /api/workflows/create` that needs a paid plan does not
fail after the fact. To see which plan your organization is on and which features that plan
unlocks, `GET /api/features` returns the org's feature snapshot (plan, enabled feature ids,
and the full registry); it authenticates with the same `Authorization` header as every other
agent route.

## Get Organization Features

```http
GET /api/features
```

Returns the calling organization's feature snapshot so a client can render per-plan lock states or preflight a workflow build.

### Response

```json
{
  "plan": "free",
  "enabledFeatureIds": [],
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "action.database-query",
      "name": "Database Query action",
      "description": "Run SQL queries against connected databases inside workflows.",
      "category": "workflow-action",
      "enabled": true,
      "requiredPlan": "pro",
      "actionTypes": ["Database Query"]
    }
  ],
  "billingEnabled": true
}
```

`billingEnabled` is `false` on self-hosted installs where billing is disabled, in which case `plan` is `"enterprise"` and every feature is enabled.
