# Getting Started with an Agent

KeeperHub exposes workflows, executions, and direct onchain execution as
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools, so an agent can build and run
automations without a browser.

## 1. Connect

The hosted server is at `https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp`. In Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user keeperhub https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp
```

Run `/mcp` to complete OAuth in your browser. That mints a short-lived Bearer access token, which
is the right credential for an interactive agent.

For headless or CI environments where no browser redirect is possible, pass an organization API
key instead:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user keeperhub https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer kh_your_key_here"
```

Create that key in the app under your avatar, then **API Keys**, then the **Organisation** tab.
Organization keys start with `kh_`. User keys (`wfb_`) authenticate webhook triggers and are not
interchangeable. See [API Keys](/api/api-keys).

Confirm the connection by asking your agent to list your workflows.

## 2. Know the tools you need

The server exposes more than forty tools. Four cover the whole first loop:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `list_workflows` | Find a workflow and its id |
| `execute_workflow` | Start a run, returns an execution id |
| `get_execution` | Read status, output, and transaction hashes for a run |
| `ai_generate_workflow` | Scaffold a workflow from a plain-language description |

`get_execution_status` and `get_execution_logs` still resolve, but both are deprecated aliases of
`get_execution`. `search_plugins` is a deprecated alias of `list_action_schemas`, and `get_template`
of `get_workflow`. Prefer the current names.

The full list, including workflow CRUD, templates, integrations, and marketplace listings, is in
the [MCP Server reference](/agent/mcp-server).

## 3. Run a workflow

Ask the agent to run one. `execute_workflow` returns an execution id immediately rather than
waiting for the result, then `get_execution` reads the outcome.

A run reaches one of these terminal states:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `success` | Completed |
| `error` | Failed from bad input, workflow logic, or an external dependency |
| `system_error` | Failed inside KeeperHub infrastructure |
| `cancelled` | Stopped before completing |

`pending`, `running`, and `unconfirmed` are non-terminal: keep reading until you see one of the
four above. Treat anything other than `success` as a failure. Checking only for `error` misses
`system_error` and `cancelled`.

## 4. Write onchain, safely

For a one-off onchain action with no workflow around it, use the direct execution
tools: `execute_transfer`, `execute_contract_call`, `execute_check_and_execute`, and
`execute_protocol_action`. The first three take a `simulate` flag. `execute_protocol_action`
has no dry run - it executes the action when called and silently ignores a
`simulate` flag if one is passed (it does not stop the broadcast) - so
treat it as a broadcast and make the call itself the smallest possible step. Where the
protocol exposes a read action (for example a `chronicle/eth-usd-read` or
`morpho/get-position` actionType), calling that first returns current state, but it cannot
tell you whether a particular write will revert; there is no substitute for a dry run here.

**Know the wallet that signs direct executions.** Broadcasts come from your organization's
Turnkey wallet, not your own. Discover its address over REST with `GET /api/user/wallet`
(`walletAddress` for EVM, `solanaAddress` for Solana) or `GET /api/integrations` (canonical
EIP-55 checksummed `address`, preferred when an address must match exactly). Over MCP, call
`list_integrations` to find the web3 integration, then `get_wallet_integration` with that
integration's id - it returns the address as `walletAddress`. What a direct execution debits
from the wallet is the value a write moves, not the gas: on sponsored chains a relayer pays
the network fee. (A step configured against a Safe spends the Safe's balance instead.) See
[User API](/api/user) and [Integrations](/api/integrations).

Always preflight the three simulate-capable tools:

1. Call the tool with `simulate: true`.
2. Continue only when the result reports `success: true` and `wouldRevert: false`.
3. Repeat the call with `simulate` omitted, passing a fresh `idempotency_key`.
4. Poll `get_direct_execution_status` with the returned `executionId` until it is terminal. Wait
   the number of seconds in the `X-Poll-Interval-Hint` response header between polls; `0` means
   the execution is terminal and you can stop.
5. Keep `transactionLink` from the terminal response as the onchain proof.

`execute_protocol_action` is not in that loop: it has no simulate step, so call it once with
an `idempotency_key`. A write action answers `202` with an envelope carrying `executionId`
and a `status` of `completed`, `failed`, or `unconfirmed` (plus `transactionHash` and
`transactionLink` when the write produced one). Only `completed` and `failed` are terminal:
when the status is `unconfirmed` the transaction is broadcast but not yet confirmed, so poll
`get_direct_execution_status` with the returned `executionId` until it is terminal - never
re-send an `unconfirmed` execution, the transaction may still land. (A read actionType
returns the read value instead, as above.)

**Simulation is EVM-only.** On Solana mainnet (`101`) and devnet (`103`), a `simulate: true` call
resolves with `isError: true` rather than throwing. Parse the JSON in `content[0].text` and stop
when `error` is `simulation_unsupported_chain`:

```json
{
  "error": "simulation_unsupported_chain",
  "message": "Direct-execution simulation is not supported on this chain.",
  "chain_id": 101,
  "hint": "Direct-execution simulation is EVM-only. Preflight with a Solana-aware client before broadcasting."
}
```

Solana transfers can still broadcast; only the preflight is unavailable.

## Per-workflow servers

Any listed marketplace workflow is also reachable as its own typed MCP server at
`https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp/w/<slug>`, exposing that single workflow with its real input schema
instead of the full toolset. See [MCP Server](/agent/mcp-server).

## Rate limits

| Context | Limit |
|---|---|
| MCP, per organization | 120 requests / minute |
| Public MCP `tools/call`, per IP | 10 requests / minute |
| Direct execution, per API key | 60 requests / minute |

Rate-limited requests return `429` with a `Retry-After` header in seconds. Wait at least that
long, then back off exponentially. Pass a stable `idempotency_key` on writes so a retry cannot
double-spend.
