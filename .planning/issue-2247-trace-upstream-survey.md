# Issue 2247: Trace-method availability across chain upstreams

Research survey for [#2247](https://github.com/KeeperHub/keeperhub/issues/2247). No trigger implementation. No Aetherlay changes. No secrets.

**What #2241 is.** [#2241](https://github.com/KeeperHub/keeperhub/issues/2241) is the parent issue this survey serves: it proposes sourcing triggers from block traces so that workflows can see reverted transactions, internal ETH transfers, `delegatecall` and unlogged privileged calls, none of which `eth_getLogs` can see. #2247 was split out of it because #2241 cannot be scoped or estimated until upstream trace capability, pricing tier and response size are known. Every reference to #2241 below means that parent issue and the decision it is waiting on.

**Tree:** `CHAIN_CONFIG` / `PUBLIC_RPCS` at `staging` (`lib/rpc/rpc-config.ts`). 24 entries: 12 mainnets (11 EVM + Solana) and 12 testnets.

**What this can and cannot see.** Production primary/fallback URLs live in `CHAIN_RPC_CONFIG` (AWS Parameter Store / Helm), which is not in this repository. `rpc-config.ts` resolves `JSON config → env var → PUBLIC_RPCS`. `scripts/seed/seed-chains.ts` writes the **resolved** primary and fallback into the chains table — the output of `getRpcUrlByChainId(chainId, "primary" | "fallback")`, not `PUBLIC_RPCS` literally — and re-seeds on every deploy. On a configured install that resolution lands on the JSON config or the env vars; on a self-hosted or unconfigured install it falls through to `PUBLIC_RPCS`, which is why the public defaults are what such an install actually runs. This survey measures those defaults live, and records commercial-provider tiers from public docs for whoever production is actually pointed at. Filling the production-plan cells needs a maintainer with Parameter Store and billing access.

**Probe window:** 2026-09-03, ~11:12–11:20 ICT. Unauthenticated POST only. Sequential, one recent block per endpoint (typically ~8 blocks behind `latest`, then a block with ≥1 tx on endpoints that answered). No API keys. If a request required a key, the cell is **unverified** and filled from docs.

**Methods, in order:** `debug_traceBlockByNumber` with `{"tracer":"callTracer","timeout":"15s"}`, `trace_block`, `ots_getBlockTransactions` / `ots_getInternalOperations`. `eth_chainId` (or Solana `getHealth`) as liveness control.

## Aetherlay method allowlist

Issue #2247 cites `aetherlay/internal/server/server.go:410` and expects Aetherlay **not** to allowlist JSON-RPC methods.

That path is **not in this repository**. Evidence:

- `GET /repos/KeeperHub/keeperhub/contents/aetherlay?ref=staging` → **404**
- `GET .../contents/aetherlay/internal/server/server.go?ref=staging` → **404**
- Recursive git tree of `staging` contains **zero** paths matching `aetherlay/` or `server.go`

The only in-tree mention is a comment in `keeperhub-events/event-tracker/src/chains/provider-manager.ts` (Aetherlay Prometheus counters vs WebSocket tunnelling). That does not confirm or deny a JSON-RPC method allowlist.

**Conclusion from public evidence:** the no-allowlist claim is **maintainer-asserted**, not verified here. That is a statement about this tree, not about the question: Aetherlay is a separate repository — the Go RPC load balancer that fronts these upstreams — so whether production Aetherlay passes `debug_*` / `trace_*` / `ots_*` through is settled by reading the method handling in that repository, by someone with access to it. It is out of scope here only because the code is not here.

## Recommendation (which chains are viable for trace triggers)

A negative result on the established EVM mainnets is the useful result.

**Viable on the tree-configured public defaults today**

| Chain | Why |
|---|---|
| Plasma mainnet (`9745`) | Official `https://rpc.plasma.to` served `debug_traceBlockByNumber`, `trace_block`, **and** `ots_*` without a key. 5-tx block: 63 kB / 101 kB / 7.5 kB, 172–325 ms fetch. |
| Tempo mainnet (`4217`) | Official `https://rpc.tempo.xyz` served `debug_traceBlockByNumber` and `trace_block`. 1-tx block: 6.2 kB / 3.7 kB, ~70 ms. `ots_*` is `method not allowed`. |
| Plasma testnet, Tempo testnet | Same methods as their mainnets, small payloads. |
| Base Sepolia, BNB testnet, ETH Sepolia (`trace_block` on PublicNode), OP Sepolia (`trace_block` on PublicNode), Robinhood testnet (`debug_*` on dRPC) | Useful for developing a trigger, not a production coverage story. |

**Not viable on public defaults (the chains #2241 actually cares about)**

Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNB mainnet, OP mainnet, Avalanche, Robinhood mainnet, 0G official RPC, and both Solana networks. Exact refusal bodies differ (`method not found`, `rpc method is not whitelisted`, `rpc method is unsupported`, PublicNode archive-token gate, Ankr/1RPC key-or-quota gate, Robinhood 429) but the outcome is the same: **the last-resort upstreams do not give a keeper a full-block trace.**

0G's **fallback** `https://0g.drpc.org` did answer `debug_traceBlockByNumber` (15 kB, 153 ms) without a key, while dRPC's Ethereum docs say debug/trace are paid-only. Treat that as chain-specific leakage, not a plan we can design around. `trace_block` on the same host failed to route.

**If production is Alchemy / Infura / QuickNode / Ankr** (unverified against `CHAIN_RPC_CONFIG`):

| Provider | Free / current public plan includes debug+trace? | Paid tier that does |
|---|---|---|
| Alchemy | **No.** Debug API and Trace API are ✗ on Free, ✓ on PAYG / Enterprise. | PAYG. `debug_traceBlockByNumber` = 40 CU; `trace_block` = 20 CU. |
| Infura | **No.** Trace API is "available to paying Infura customers." Core Free does not list Debug/Trace; Developer ($50/mo) does. | Developer+. `debug_traceBlockByNumber` = 1000 credits; `trace_block` = 300 credits. |
| QuickNode | **No, per 2026 comparison.** Trace and debug "accessible on all paid plans" at 2× credit rate. | Paid plans. |
| Ankr | **No.** Trace and Debug are ✗ on Public and Freemium, ✓ on Premium. | Premium PAYG (min $10) or Deal. |
| dRPC | **No** on Ethereum docs ("Available only on the paid tier"). Per-chain: Robinhood mainnet dRPC returned `method is not available on free plan`; Plasma dRPC `chain is not available on free plan`. | Paid. |

**Implication for #2241:** do not implement full-block trace triggers against `PUBLIC_RPCS` for ETH / Base / Arb / Polygon / BSC / OP / Avax. Scope is either (a) Plasma and Tempo, whose official public RPCs already trace, or (b) production keyed upstreams **after** a maintainer confirms the live `CHAIN_RPC_CONFIG` provider and that the billed plan includes Debug/Trace. Polling `callTracer` once per block is cheap in CU/credits where the method exists; the blocker is **access**, not unit price.

## Size and time bounds (only sourced numbers)

**Units.** Every byte figure measured in this survey is decimal: kB = 1 000 B, MB = 1 000 000 B. The raw byte counts in the tables are the measurement; the kB and MB figures beside them are rounded from those counts. The Tatum caps quoted below are left in the binary units (MiB) that Tatum's own documentation uses.

Measured `callTracer` / `trace_block` payloads for **non-empty** blocks in this survey ranged from **1 718 B to 3 635 528 B** (1.7 kB to 3.6 MB), with fetch **53–325 ms**. Empty blocks fall outside that range rather than at its bottom: they return a 36-byte `[]` wrapper (see the method notes below), so a minimum-length sanity check written off the 1 718 B floor would reject exactly the case a trigger has to tolerate. `json.loads` of those bodies was **<1 ms** on the probe host; fetch dominates.

**These sizes are one-block samples, and the block-to-block spread is several-fold.** Trace size scales with a block's internal **call depth**, not with its transaction count, so a second sample of the same chain at the same transaction count can differ by a large multiple. Concretely: the probe added in [#2277](https://github.com/KeeperHub/keeperhub/pull/2277) measured a different 5-tx plasma-mainnet block at 348 kB / 562 kB for `debug_traceBlockByNumber` / `trace_block`, against the 63 kB / 101 kB recorded here, while `ots_getBlockTransactions` came out at 7.5 kB in both runs — `ots_` scales with transaction count, the tracers do not. Neither run is wrong. Do not size capacity off a single figure in these tables; re-run the probe across a range of blocks to bound the envelope #2241 needs.

Provider-agnostic upper bounds, **not** measured here:

- Tatum: default (opcode) tracer on a busy BSC block can exceed **160 MiB** (their default cap) and they raised BSC mainnet to **512 MiB** because some blocks legitimately produce traces that large. `callTracer` "typically drop[s] by one to two orders of magnitude." Source: <https://docs.tatum.io/docs/evm-handling-response-is-too-big-32008-on-debug-trace-methods>
- Dwellir: "A full trace of a dense block can be hundreds of megabytes in size." Source: <https://www.dwellir.com/docs/ethereum/debug_traceBlockByNumber>

A keeper that used the default opcode tracer would hit those caps. `callTracer` is the method this survey used and the one #2241 should assume.

## Commercial provider matrix (docs only, unverified against production)

Production may already be on one of these via `CHAIN_RPC_CONFIG`. None of these rows were live-probed: every hosted URL embeds an API key, which this survey does not use.

| Provider | Debug / Trace on free or current public plan? | Paid access | Per-call cost (docs) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alchemy | **No.** Feature table: Debug API ✗ Free, ✓ PAYG / Enterprise. Quickstart: "your Alchemy plan must be set to the pay as you go or enterprise tiers." | PAYG | `debug_traceBlockByNumber` 40 CU; `trace_block` 20 CU. Free pool 30M CU/mo does not unlock the API. | <https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/pricing-plans.md>, <https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/debug-api-quickstart>, <https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/compute-unit-costs> |
| Infura | **No.** "Trace API is an open beta feature, available to paying Infura customers." Pricing page: Debug/Trace listed under Developer ($50/mo), not Core Free. | Developer $50/mo, Team, Enterprise | `debug_traceBlockByNumber` 1000 credits; `trace_block` 300 credits. Core Free quota 3M credits/day would be plenty if the API were unlocked; it is not. | <https://docs.infura.io/reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/trace-methods.md>, <https://www.infura.io/pricing>, <https://docs.infura.io/get-started/pricing/credit-cost.md> |
| QuickNode | **No, per 2026 comparison.** "Trace and debug APIs … are accessible on all paid plans at 2× the standard credit rate." (A 2022 QuickNode blog said add-ons were removed and features sit on every plan, including Free; the 2026 source is the one used here.) | Paid plans | 2× credit multiplier for Trace & Debug. | <https://www.quicknode.com/blog/best-ethereum-rpc-providers-2026-a-full-comparison> |
| Ankr | **No.** Service-plans table: Trace ✗ / Debug ✗ on Public and Freemium; ✓ Premium. Freemium is free 200M credits/mo and still does not include Trace/Debug. | Premium PAYG (min $10) or Deal | 200 credits per EVM method on HTTPS (~$0.00002). | <https://www.ankr.com/docs/rpc-service/service-plans/> |
| dRPC | **No** on Ethereum docs. Live: mixed per chain (see tables). | Paid tier | Not used (no key). | <https://drpc.org/docs/ethereum-api/debugandtrace> |
| PublicNode / Allnodes | Free RPC: debug namespace not served on the endpoints in this tree. `trace_block` on ETH/OP **mainnet** demands a personal token; the same host on some **testnets** served `trace_block` without one. | Personal token / Allnodes plan | n/a | Probe error: "Archive requests require a personal token. Get one at: https://www.allnodes.com/publicnode" |
| 1RPC | Public ETH endpoint quota-limited this run (`-32001`). 1RPC is a privacy relay, not documented here as an archive/debug node. Trace **unverified**. | Keyed plans exist (error links `#pricing`) | n/a | Probe of `https://1rpc.io/eth`; <https://www.1rpc.io/> |

## Cells only a maintainer can fill

1. The live `CHAIN_RPC_CONFIG` JSON: provider + whether each chain's primary/fallback is keyed Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode, Ankr, dRPC, or something else.
2. Whether the billed plan on that provider is Free (no debug/trace at Alchemy/Infura/Ankr) or PAYG/Developer/Premium.
3. Whether Aetherlay in production allowlists JSON-RPC methods (`aetherlay/internal/server/server.go:410` is not in this repo).
4. Production WSS vs HTTP: this survey is HTTP POST only.

Until (1) and (2) are filled, #2241 should treat "works on all EVM mainnets" as **false** for public defaults and **unknown** for production.

## Method notes for #2241

- Prefer `debug_traceBlockByNumber` + `callTracer`. It is the method Alchemy documents for "traces executed in the block," it is what we measured, and it is 10–100× smaller than the opcode tracer (Tatum).
- `trace_block` (Parity/Erigon style) is a viable alternative where Geth debug is disabled but OpenEthereum-style tracing is on (ETH Sepolia PublicNode, BNB testnet PublicNode, OP Sepolia PublicNode, Plasma, Tempo). Response shape differs (`action`/`result` vs `callTracer` trees); a trigger would need both parsers or a single adapter.
- Otterscan `ots_*` was only a real full-block source on Plasma (`rpc.plasma.to` / `testnet-rpc.plasma.to`). Everywhere else it was `-32601` or `method not allowed`. Do not design the trigger around `ots_*` unless Plasma is the only target.
- Solana stays out of this design.
- Empty blocks return `[]` (36-byte JSON-RPC wrapper). A trigger must tolerate that; Tempo produces them often.

## Reproducing a cell

A committed harness now exists: `scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs`, added by [#2277](https://github.com/KeeperHub/keeperhub/pull/2277). It parses the chain list out of `lib/rpc/rpc-config.ts` at run time, probes `debug_traceBlockByNumber`, `trace_block` and `ots_getBlockTransactions` against both the primary and the fallback of every entry, and records the verbatim response body, raw and gzipped size, and fetch and parse time — the same methods, endpoints and quantities this survey reports.

```bash
node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs --dry-run    # resolve targets, make no requests
node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs --mainnets   # EVM mainnets only
node scripts/trace-method-probe.mjs              # all chains
```

**What re-running reproduces, and what it does not.** The tables above were built from single manual `curl` probes taken in the window given at the top of this document, before that harness existed. Re-running regenerates the availability and refusal matrix, and that part is stable: the negative cells are deterministic method-and-tier refusals. It will **not** reproduce the byte counts or the latencies cell for cell, because a different block is sampled and trace size varies several-fold with call depth. Treat the positive size and timing cells as single observations, not as reproducible constants.

A single cell by hand, unauthenticated, no key:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$RPC_URL" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"debug_traceBlockByNumber","params":["0xLATEST_MINUS_8",{"tracer":"callTracer","timeout":"15s"}]}'
```

Replace the method with `trace_block` (single block-hex param) or `ots_getBlockTransactions` (`[blockHex, 0, 10]`).
