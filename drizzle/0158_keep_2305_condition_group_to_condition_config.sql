-- Issue #2305: remove a Condition node's rule group from the unread top-level `group`
-- key, and promote it to `conditionConfig` only where doing so cannot change which
-- expression the node evaluates.
--
-- lib/workflow/node-builders.ts emitted `data.config.group`, a key
-- resolveConditionExpression has never read: it takes `conditionConfig.group` or
-- `condition`, so the rules under a top-level `group` are not the rules that run.
--
-- Until #2359 that was loud. processActionConfig lifts only `condition` and
-- `conditionConfig` before rendering, and the renderer did not walk into objects, so
-- `group.rules` kept its unrendered `{{...}}` tokens and the leftover-literal scan aborted
-- the run. renderTemplateValue walks arrays and objects now, so those tokens render, the
-- scan has nothing to report, and the node runs - without its rules. The fault did not go
-- away with the abort; only the signal did. A loud failure became a quiet one, which is
-- why this repair matters more after #2359 than before it.
--
-- The rows cannot be repaired from the editor: opening a seeded Condition node parses
-- the `condition` string into a group and persists it as `conditionConfig`, but never
-- deletes the stale top-level `group`, so the stale key survives the edit. Nor can any seeder
-- reach them. lib/auth.ts:871-886 inserts the three fixtures for a new organization
-- without an id and without `seededAt`, so scripts/seed/seed-onboarding-workflows.ts,
-- which selects by the fixture's fixed id and refreshes only a row whose `updatedAt` is
-- within USER_EDIT_EPSILON_MS of its `seededAt`, matches neither by id nor by age. Every
-- organization provisioned so far therefore holds rows only a migration can repair.
--
-- Removing the stale key is the whole repair. resolveConditionExpression has never read
-- the top-level `group`, so deleting it cannot change what runs, and the editor rebuilds
-- `conditionConfig` from the `condition` string the next time the node is opened. What
-- the editor could not do is delete the key, which is the one thing this does.
--
-- Promotion is the part that can change what runs, so it is narrow. resolveConditionExpression
-- (lib/workflow/nodes/condition/resolver.ts:24-31) prefers `conditionConfig.group` and falls
-- through to `config.condition` only when it is absent, and handleModeSwitch("expression")
-- (components/workflow/config/action-config.tsx:350-353) clears `conditionConfig` precisely
-- so the raw string wins. Nothing clears the top-level `group`: sanitize-nodes.ts:168 spreads
-- `...config`, so on a seeded workflow it survives every save. A seeded Condition a user
-- switched to expression mode and edited therefore reaches this statement as
-- `{group: <seeded>, condition: <the user's>}`, and promoting the group would silently
-- start evaluating the seeded condition instead of theirs.
--
-- Shape alone cannot tell that row from an untouched seeded one, which arrives as
-- `{group: <seeded>, condition: <generated from that group>}`. The two differ only in
-- whether `condition` equals visualConditionToExpression(group), which SQL cannot compute
-- without a second copy of the generator. So the group is promoted only where there is no
-- expression to outrank, and dropped everywhere else. Dropping still removes the stale
-- key, which skipping the row would not.
--
-- Both group guards test `jsonb_typeof(... 'group') = 'object'` rather than key presence, so
-- a node carrying `"group": null` or a non-object `group` is left exactly as it is. Writing
-- `{"group": null}` into `conditionConfig` would be worse than the state being repaired:
-- action-config.tsx calls visualConditionToExpression whenever conditionConfig is truthy
-- and groupToExpression dereferences `group.rules`, so the editor would throw on open.
--
-- The expression test is `jsonb_typeof(...) = 'string' AND btrim(#>> ..., E' \t\n\r\f\x0b') <> ''`.
-- `#>` returns SQL NULL for an absent key, and jsonb_typeof of that is NULL, so an absent
-- `condition` fails the test and the group is promoted rather than dropped.
--
-- Idempotent. A row whose Condition nodes no longer carry a top-level `group` is not
-- matched, so a second run reports UPDATE 0. Covered by
-- tests/unit/migration-0158-condition-group-to-condition-config.test.ts.
--
-- `updated_at` is deliberately left alone: this is a repair, not a user edit, and
-- moving it would reorder every affected workflow in the user's list.
--
-- Under READ COMMITTED the subquery computes `fixed.nodes` from the pre-statement snapshot,
-- so a workflow saved inside the statement's window is re-checked for the join qualifier and
-- then overwritten with the already-computed value, discarding that save. The window is the
-- statement's own runtime, about a second at 50k rows. Whether that matters is the row
-- count, which I cannot read from a fork:
--   SELECT count(*) FROM workflows
--   WHERE nodes @> '[{"data":{"config":{"actionType":"Condition"}}}]';
-- Nothing here enforces that anyone runs it, and --@requires-db-prep does not apply
-- (db-prep-check.yml scopes it to CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY), so the number decides:
-- say it and I will batch this by id range, or say it is small and this note can go.
