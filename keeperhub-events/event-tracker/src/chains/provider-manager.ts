/**
 * ChainProviderManager centralises WebSocket provider ownership and
 * block-based log delivery per chain. One provider and one
 * `eth_subscribe(newHeads)` subscription per chainId, regardless of how
 * many listeners are registered for that chain.
 *
 * Log delivery uses block subscription + batched `eth_getLogs` rather than
 * one `eth_subscribe(logs, ...)` per listener. This decouples RPC-side
 * subscription count from workflow count (provider subscription caps are
 * typically ~1000 per WSS).
 *
 * Request volume is driven by block rate, so a sub-second chain costs orders
 * of magnitude more than a 12 s one for the same subscriptions. Requests are
 * therefore rate limited rather than issued per block: each chain keeps a
 * high-water mark of the last block it has served, and a drain fetches
 * `(mark, head]` at most once per `GETLOGS_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`.
 *
 * Nothing branches on how fast a chain is. A chain whose blocks arrive
 * further apart than that interval always finds it already elapsed and
 * dispatches immediately - one request per block, as before - while a faster
 * one accumulates against the mark and is served in one ranged request. The
 * range is contiguous, so blocks the subscription never pushed are covered
 * too, and the mark survives a reconnect so a replacement connection resumes
 * rather than starting blind.
 *
 * Per-chain reconnect + heartbeat are owned here. Drop detection uses two
 * signals:
 *   - `provider.on("error")` for transport-level errors surfaced by ethers
 *   - An active heartbeat that pings `eth_blockNumber` every
 *     `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` with a `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` cap
 *
 * A passive `websocket.on("close")` hook was considered but rejected: it
 * reaches into `(provider as any).websocket`, breaks between ethers
 * versions, and adds no detection we do not already get from the
 * heartbeat. Detection latency is bounded by heartbeat cadence, which is
 * tuneable via the constants below.
 *
 * On drop: fire registered `onDisconnect` handlers, then attempt reconnect
 * with exponential backoff. On exhaustion: call the injected
 * `onPermanentFailure` callback (defaults to `process.exit(1)` so K8s
 * restarts the pod - tests inject a no-op).
