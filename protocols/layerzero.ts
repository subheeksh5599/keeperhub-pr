// ERC-20 approval first. The four L2 entries are Mint and Burn OFT
// Adapters (approvalRequired() false), and on each of them token()
// returns the chain's USDT0 deployment listed in the map below, not the

// rebranded in place: eth_call name() on 2026-09-08 returns "USDT0" on
// 137 and "USD₮0" on 42161, alongside "USD₮0" on 10 and

    // the same mainnet fork and sky.ts provisions tokens through
    // requiredTokens. Leaving it skipped left the protocol's only write
    // with no end-to-end coverage.
    //
    // The real constraint is USDT-specific and worth knowing before this
    // fixture is edited: USDT's approve reverts when it would move a
    // non-zero allowance straight to another non-zero value
    // (`require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)))`).
    // So the fixture depends on the allowance being zero when it runs, and
    // on it running once per fork.
    //
    // Zero at the start, per actor. Tier 1 does not sign at all: it sends
    // from SIM_WALLET through anvil impersonation, and that account's live
    // mainnet allowance to the adapter is 0 (eth_call, 2026-09-08). Tier 2
    // signs with the persistent Turnkey test wallet, whose address lives
    // in the CI database rather than this repo, so its live allowance is
    // asserted by the fixture rather than checked here: if that wallet
    // ever approves USDT to this adapter on real mainnet, every fresh fork
    // inherits the allowance and this write starts reverting.
    //
    // Once per fork. planPhaseFixtures maps one case per action
    // (lib/test-data/plan.ts), run-fixture.ts fires the webhook once per
    // case and never re-fires, and the five trigger variants give no test
    // signal on the webhook path so they are not enumerated (see that
    // file's header). vitest.config.mts sets no `retry` and the shard
    // command passes none. A GitHub job re-run starts a new anvil, so it
    // re-forks rather than replaying against used state; the nightly fork
    // cache holds anvil's upstream fetches, not local mutations.
    //
    // The runner re-fire case is the one worth spelling out, because
    // `maxRetries = 0` reads like it only governs failures. The executor
    // re-delivers a step when its completion event is lost, and
    // @workflow/core's step handler counts `step_started` events and
    // checks `step.attempt > maxRetries + 1` *before* running the step
    // body. That package is not a direct dependency, which is why no
    // version for it appears in package.json: it arrives under
    // `workflow` 4.8.5 (package.json:158) and is pinned as
    // `@workflow/core@4.8.5` in pnpm-lock.yaml, so the citation is
    // checkable from the repo - dist/runtime/step-handler.js:264 in
    // that version, verified 2026-09-09. A re-fire arrives
    // as attempt 2, trips that guard at 2 > 1, and is failed by event
    // without calling protocolWriteStep again. So a second approve cannot
    // be broadcast from one execution.

    // The ERC-20 ABI declares approve with no outputs, rather than the bool
    // the general ERC-20 shape returns. USDT returns no data at all, and
    // chain 1's reference token is USDT, so the declaration has to cover
    // both shapes.
    //
    // The mismatch is not inert, which is what a bool declaration would
    // assume. On the EOA path, EvmChainAdapter.executeContractCall runs a
    // preflight `staticCall` before broadcasting (lib/web3/chain-adapter/
    // evm.ts), and ethers decodes that call's return data against the
    // declared outputs. Against USDT it decodes "0x" as a bool and throws
    // BAD_DATA, so the approve fails before it is sent, with "Contract
    // returned no data, but the ABI you supplied declares 1 output (bool)".
    // It is a decode error reported as a contract failure.
    //
    // Only that path decodes. Safe, Safe-role and Turnkey-sponsored sends
    // encode the call and estimate gas without a staticCall
    // (lib/safe/execute-as-safe.ts, lib/web3/sponsored-transaction-manager.ts),
    // so a bool declaration survives them. Stating this precisely matters:
    // the same node, ABI and token fails for an EOA connection and succeeds
    // for a Safe one, so a repro that omits the signer mode proves nothing.
    //
    // An empty `outputs` decodes both shapes: ethers reads nothing and
    // ignores the 32 bytes a conforming token returns. Nothing downstream
    // loses information, because a write step surfaces no return value
    // either way - writeContractCore returns `result: undefined`.
